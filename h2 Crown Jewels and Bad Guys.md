# h2 Assignment
This assignment is part of the Tero Karvinen's course Trust to Blockchain 2023 autumn. (Karvinen 26 October 2023.)

## Article by Hutchins, E. Cloppert, M & Amin. R, summary
Definitions
APT - advanced persistent threat
CND - computer network defence model

Aim of the article is to give reader understanding what kind of models can be used to defence, how to apply them in intelligence driven CND and explain these through a case study.

 * APT are often successfull due to wrong assumptions
 * Human factor plays decisive role
 * Prevention requires development in analysis, processes and technology
 * Cyber Kill chain model demonstrates 7 steps of the attacks 
 * Kill chain requires success in each step and therefore mitigation in just one chain phase disrupts the attack
 * APT adversaries are patient and calulating and therefore each kill chain phase intrusions must be analyzed carefully to be able to prevent intrusions that might come after months
 * There are several models that can disrupt the kill chain, e.g. IED, ABSAC, SCP and F2T2EA
 * Intelligent CND requires careful mapping and analyzing
