# h2 Assignment
This assignment is part of the Tero Karvinen's course Trust to Blockchain 2023 autumn. (Karvinen 2 November 2023.)

## 1. Intelligence-driven CND, summary
Definitions
APT - advanced persistent threat
CND - computer network defence model

Aim of the article is to give reader understanding what kind of models can be used to defence, how to apply them in intelligence driven CND and explain these through a case study.

 * APT are often successfull due to wrong assumptions
 * Human factor plays decisive role
 * Prevention requires development in analysis, processes and technology
 * Cyber Kill chain model demonstrates 7 steps of the attacks 
 * Kill chain requires success in each step and therefore mitigation in just one chain phase disrupts the attack
 * APT adversaries are patient and calulating and therefore each kill chain phase intrusions must be analyzed carefully to be able to prevent intrusions that might come after months
 * There are several models that can disrupt the kill chain, e.g. IED, ABSAC, SCP and F2T2EA
 * Intelligent CND requires careful mapping and analyzing
(Hutchins, Cloppert & Amin.)

## 2. Threat modeling, Chapter 1 summary 
* Thread modeling is helping to find security problems, enhances to see the bigger picture, enhances to prevent problems before they exists and points out threats that might come to your way.
* This chapter provides step by step instuctions of how you can do threat modeling with different tools like Elevation of Privilage game, STRIDE Mnemonic framework or threat modeling of your own
* Provides a checklist to complete the modeling

## 3. Installing Debian on virtual box
As a non-technical person, I had no idea what the assignment was. First I started to look the instructions and got totally confused. Couldn't understand what is Debian, what I'm downloading, how to download and what I suppose to do after downloading. Got stuck here as the instructions were really unclear and full of technical vocabulary. In this point I stopped, I was thinking that I am not able to do this with my knowledge. 

Next day I got back to this assignment and now started by reading about Debian and virtual box, so in this point I understood that I am downloading Linux based virtual operating system to work in Windows PC. Live installation image allows this without any changes in hard drive. Got it - now I start to understand assignment a little bit. (Debian 2022 & 2023.)

In this point I looked the assighment (Karvinen 2 November 2023) and Install Debian virtual box instructions (Karvinen 2023) again closely and I realized that I might understand what the task actually is. The day before I had two other course deadlines and obviously my brain was overwhelmed with that. Let's give it a try now.
