## Summary & analysis of HELSEC presentation
Presentation was part of the HELSEC meetup at October. Presenter was Elias Alanko CISO of 3stepIT. 

It started by defining some crucial terms in BEC (Business Email Compromise) scams. I joined 19.14 and presentation was already on and therefore I had to do some additional digging to understand difference between consepts. Also, as I am not technical person I was not sure what is the difference between pretexting and phising. Both are one type of social engineering. In pretexting scammer creates imaginary scenario to steel persons personal information. In phising scammer relies on sense of urgency. (Pettit 1 March 2023.)

According to Alanko, pretext scam try outs have in a short time increased their share of BEC scams from 27% to over fifty percent. He also pointed that phising causes yearly 4.91 million USD losses (including indirect costs), where in Finland typical losts are tens of thousands. However, he also showed a list of Finnish companies that were the target of significant scams from 2015-2018. These can be also found in his LinkedIn Article mentioned in references below. Presentation also included some examples in media during this year.

I have long backgroun in C-level management and before his examples I was thinking that this is not really happening in corporate world. I have had on monthly basis contacts that have been revealed to be fraudulent attempts. Basically, I'm suspicious of all contacts that I don't recognize, and that's why I imagined that others act this way too.

On the other hand, I have worked in relatively small organizations where everyone knows each other, payment transactions have been in my hands and suppliers have always notified e.g. account number changes through the official mail. The spread of eInvoices has also changed the field. The examples given by Alango were from large companies, where the operating culture certainly enables mistakes like this, if they are not prepared for. 

I've also never thought about how money transfers across state borders make monitoring difficult - the authorities can't keep up with the transfers.

I also liked the idea of ”sharing is caring” 3StepIT shares all the suspicious emails or fraud attacs to Nordic finance teams. I'm a big supporter of transparency, and that's why I believe that this kind of action will bring good results in order to avoid scams.

## Reflection
First of all, this was very nice practice. I didn't have any strategy, I was just reading answers and thinking from there what should I ask next. Levels 3-6 where very easy once I understood what to ask. This was more like trial and error kind of task for me, when something worked I tried it again and if it didn't - had to find another way to ask. In general this gave very good understanding what kind of limitations AI has - if it is not in the algorythm you can go around security issues with very simple questions like "what should I write below this box?"

This is not a small issue as 71% of IT leaders consider large language models (LLM) will bring new security risks. Even tough Generative AI are seen as a huge relief for many tasks 55 % of IT leaders thinks that they have to protect business from security threats. (Comeau 8 March 2023.) 

All in all, the models of doing things are in front of the new, and generative artificial intelligence also gives criminals an effective tool for faster, more sophisticated and more inventive attacks. Through generative AI, attackers may generate new and complex types of malware, phishing schemes and other cyber dangers that can avoid conventional protection measures (Jackson 19 April 2023).
